1) You are going to provide us with the signal hub server domain right? Currently we have 'http://10.42.0.1' and I hope the endpoint (coreHub) is what we will still be using?


I will need the server available camera list endpoint if it has been implemented, I need to create a ui to display it and give the admin the opportunity to select one.

2) I will need an endpoint that will return the device ID, sensors and features availble. What we have currently, returns -1 or 0.

We are also creating a screen for this initialisation process, this screen will the information above. 

3) same as 1 above

4) I also need an endpoint for sensor testing.

Create a full-screen component to test sensors.
Display the most recent text at the top and update as more text comes from the server.
