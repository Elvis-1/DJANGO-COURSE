There are many different version control systems available. For example, Subversion, Perforce, AWS Code Commit, Mercurial, and Git to name a few.

Version control systems can be split into two types or categories. Centralized version control systems and distributed version control systems

 Centralized version control systems, or CVCS for short, contain a server and a client. The server contains the main repository that houses the full history of versions of the code base. Developers working on projects using a centralized system need to pull down the code from the server to their local machine. This gives the user their own working copy of the code base. The server holds the full history of changes.

 Distributed version control systems or DVCS for short, are similar to the centralized model. You still need to pull code down from the server to view the latest changes. The key difference is that every user is essentially a server and not a client. This means that every time you pull down code from the distributed model, you have the entire history of changes on your local system.

  let's explore some of the advantages and disadvantages of each. The advantage of CVCS is that they are considered easier to learn than their distributed counterparts. They also give more access controls to users. The disadvantage is that they can be slower given that you need to establish a connection to the server to perform any actions. With DVCS, you don't need to be connected to the server to add your changes or view a file's history. It works as if you are actually connected to the server directly but on your own local machine. You only ever need to connect to the server to pull down the latest changes or to push your own changes. It essentially allows users to work in an offline state

  Speed and performance are also better than its CVCS counterpart. DVCS is a key factor in improving developer operations and the software development life cycle
