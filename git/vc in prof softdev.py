  Workflow

  Workflows are essential to ensure code is managed correctly and reduce mistakes from happening. Different projects will have different workflows

  Continuous Integration

  Continuous Integration, or CI, is used to automate the integration of code changes from multiple developers into a single main stream. Using a workflow whereby small changes are merged frequently, often many times per day, will reduce the number of merge conflicts.

Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is an extension of Continuous Integration. Once the changes have been merged into the main stream, a Continuous Delivery system automatically packages the application and prepares it for deployment. This helps avoid human error when packaging the application.

Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is an extension of Continuous Delivery. The goal of Continuous Deployment is to deploy and release software to customers frequently and safely. The strategy commonly involves automatically deploying to a test (also known as staging) environment first to validate the deployment package and software changes. Once validated, it can automatically deploy to the live (also known as production) environment for customers.
