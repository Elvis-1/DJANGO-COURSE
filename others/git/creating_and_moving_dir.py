If I type in the LS-L command notice that I have one directory in here called projects. Now I will create a new directory called submissions

I do this by typing mkdir, which stands for make directory. And then the word submissions. 

This is the name of the directory I want to create and then I hit the enter key. I then type in ls-l for list so that I can see the list structure. And now notice that a new directory called submissions has been created.

 typing cd submissions and then press the enter key

 If I want to add some text files or some content, I can use another command called touch. I type touch test1.txt, followed by the enter key.

 To add another text file, I type in touch test2.txt followed by the entry key again. Now I run the ls-l command and noticed that the two text files are listed inside the submissions folder. After this, I want to go back to the root level directory and I do this by typing in cd..followed by the enter key. And then I run the ls-l command again and notice two directories are now listed, projects and submissions. Now I want to create another directory called archive. To do this type mkdir followed by the word archive and then hit the enter key

 To see all of the directories, enter the ls-l command followed by the entry key again. Once again, notice that three directories are now listed, archive, projects and submissions.

 To get back to the top view of my terminal, I can clear my screen by typing clear, followed by the enter key

  Okay, so let's say I want to move the submissions folder into the archive folder. This requires a different command called move written as mv. In this example, I need to specify the directory I want to move and then where to move it to. So I type in mv submissions followed by the word archive and then I hit the enter key.

  Again, I use the ls-l command and now notice that the submissions directory is listed inside of the archive directory.
