Now let me guide you through how this works using Git and Git hub. Before creating a new branch, always ensure you have the latest code. 

You can do this by running the git pull command to pull the latest code from the remote repository.

Next you need to create your new branch. You can do this by passing the -b flag with the check out action.

Next, let's add new content to this branch. Let's create a README.md file, to do this type git add. or git add README.md and press Enter.

Next, we need to commit the new file and provide a meaningful message so other developers can see what you added.

To do that Run the git commit command with a -m option to include a message with a short description of the changes being committed. 

The file has now been added to the local branch, this means that the file is only visible locally to you. To allow other developers to see the changes, you need to push the file to the remote repository. You can do that by running the git push command and referencing the new file.

The changes are now pushed to the remote repository on git hub. Your next action is to get a review as part of a pull request, but more about that later. And that brings us to the end of this video.
