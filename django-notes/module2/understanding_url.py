When you access the web from your device you may click on a web link or type in an address. The address is known as a URL And it links or points to a specific resource or web page. In this video you will learn what A URL Is and the different parts that make up A URL.

You will discover how each URL is purposefully constructed to point to a specific resource or web page on the web. Every single resource on the web is located by an address known as the uniform resource locator or URL. Every time you click on a web link or type in a web address you visit a URL.

A URL is made up of multiple parts put together. The first part is known as the scheme. This is followed by the domain name, the file path and parameters. Let's begin by exploring the scheme, Domain name and file path. The first part of A URL Is the scheme or otherwise referred to as the protocol.

It's located at the beginning of any ural address and can be identified as HTTP or HTTPS. The characters HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. The protocol determines the set of rules around the transmission and exchange of data. The difference between HTTP and HTTPS is security as the S stands for secure.

HTTP sends data as plain text which can expose the sender's information HTTPS encrypts all data. This means the data isn't in a readable format which is more secure. 

The HTTP protocol is also responsible for sending and receiving HTML across the web. HTTP and its extension HTTPS is the most widely used protocol over the web. Okay. So now that you have learned about the scheme, let's explore the sub domain and the domain. The sub domain is located before the domain and usually contains the home page and other important pages. The most common sub domain is World Wide Web represented by WWW.

It's important to know that some browsers replace the scheme and sub domain with a symbol such as that of a lock for encrypted pages. This is done to make the URLs easier to read and understand.

Next is the domain name which consists of two parts. They are second level domain and top level domain. Let's explore each of these briefly. Now the second level domain name refers to an organization or the name of a company. For example, the second level domain for the company called Little Lemon is Little Lemon. 

The part that follows the second level domain and concludes your domain name is called the top level domain. It is used to reference a country or category of your organization. For example, a .com address can indicate a commercial entity, .org means an organization and .ie represents a country, sovereign state or dependent territory.

Now that you know what the domain name consists of, Let's explore the file path. The file path also known as the page path directs you to the location of a resource. The resource may be any type of files that can be transmitted over HTTP, such as web documents, image files and metadata. It's worth remembering that a URL is simply an address where the files are stored.

They can either be local or web based, which can be external to the domain. when hosting locally, The resources such as images and web files are located on the user's device or server. When web based they exist on the user's remote web server or external server. For example, the web based URL for the 4.1 release for Django has its own URL with a specific file path which includes the year, month and day it was published. URL parameters are also known as query strings and are used to structure additional information inside a URl. 

You use URL parameters to capture any part of the URL and pass its value for processing A query string is similar. It begins with a question mark symbol and is placed after the URL Path. 

It contains parameters represented as key value pairs that can appear inside a URL path. You can add more than one by adding the ampersand symbol between parameters. Django can process both types of URL but mainly uses the URL parameters.

Finally, let's briefly explore the topic of URL Design. URL design is the practice of purposefully creating URLs. So it's important for Django developers to understand the different parts that make up A URL. This helps define well designed URLS, as the website content requirements determines how the URL will be constructed.
